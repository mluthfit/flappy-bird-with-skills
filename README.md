# Flappy Bird with Skills

This repository is the first game i made in unity. I make flappy bird with additional skills.

**Flappy Bird** is an arcade-style game in which the player controls the bird Faby, which moves persistently to the right. The player is tasked with navigating Faby through pairs of pipes that have equally sized gaps placed at random heights. (Source: [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flappy_Bird))
